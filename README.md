Hospital Management Efficiency Dashboard


📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hospital efficiency using appointment and patient data. The dashboard was built in Power BI with the goal of identifying gaps in doctor utilization, patient scheduling, and appointment management.

The analysis helps answer key questions like:

Are doctors being fully utilized compared to their available capacity?

What percentage of appointments are being completed vs. cancelled?

How long do patients wait between appointments?

Who are the top patients by number of visits?

Is there a mismatch between capacity vs. actual load?




🎯 Key KPIs Tracked


Doctor Utilization Rate: Completed Appointments / Booked Appointments

Cancellation Rate: Percentage of cancelled appointments

Average Waiting Gap: Time difference between patient appointments (per doctor)

Top Patients: Ranked by number of visits

Capacity vs. Actual Load: Assumed capacity = 8 appointments/doctor/day vs. actual handled

📊 Insights & Findings


Doctor utilization rate is only 43%, well below the target of 80% → meaning more than half of available capacity goes unused.

30% of appointments are cancelled, creating scheduling gaps and reducing efficiency.

Doctors handled fewer appointments than capacity allowed (e.g., John Doe: 4, Jane Smith: 3, Michael: 3).

Top patients drive repeat visits — e.g., Jane Smith (4 visits), John Doe (3), Michael (2).

No strong peak booking hours observed, indicating a passive booking pattern rather than active patient flow management.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Power BI → Dashboard creation & visualization

SQL → Data extraction & transformation

DAX → Custom measures & calculations (utilization rate, waiting gap, etc.)



🚀 Recommendations for Improvement

Reduce Cancellations → Automated reminders, cancellation waitlist, analyze cancellation reasons.

Boost Appointment Volume → Recall campaigns, same-day booking promotions.

Actively Manage Patient Flow → Encourage online booking, offer incentives for off-peak slots.

Data-Driven Decisions → Use KPIs to plan staffing, optimize scheduling, and improve hospital efficiency.



📈 Impact

This project highlights how data-driven hospital management can:

Improve doctor time utilization

Reduce idle capacity due to cancellations

Enhance patient engagement

Support better hospital efficiency & revenue growth

✨ By combining data analysis with actionable insights, this project demonstrates how healthcare organizations can move from reporting to truly optimizing their operations.
