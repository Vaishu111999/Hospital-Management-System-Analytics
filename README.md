# 🏥 Hospital Management System Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard analyzes hospital operational efficiency using appointment and patient data. The goal is to uncover gaps in doctor utilization, patient scheduling, and appointment management to drive actionable improvements.

Key questions addressed:
- Are doctors being fully utilized compared to their available capacity?
- What percentage of appointments are completed vs. cancelled?
- How long do patients wait between appointments?
- Who are the top patients by number of visits?
- Is there a mismatch between capacity and actual load?

---

## 🎯 Key KPIs Tracked

- **Doctor Utilization Rate**: Completed Appointments / Booked Appointments  
- **Cancellation Rate**: Percentage of cancelled appointments  
- **Average Waiting Gap**: Time difference between patient appointments (per doctor)  
- **Top Patients**: Ranked by number of visits  
- **Capacity vs. Actual Load**: Assumed capacity = 8 appointments/doctor/day vs. actual handled  

---

## 📊 Insights & Findings

- Doctor utilization rate is **43%**, well below the target of 80% → over half of available capacity goes unused.
- **30%** of appointments are cancelled, leading to scheduling gaps and reduced efficiency.
- Doctors handled fewer appointments than capacity allowed (e.g., John Doe: 4, Jane Smith: 3, Michael: 3).
- Top patients drive repeat visits — Jane Smith (4 visits), John Doe (3), Michael (2).
- No strong peak booking hours observed → indicates passive booking patterns rather than active patient flow management.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Power BI** → Dashboard creation & visualization  
- **SQL** → Data extraction & transformation  
- **DAX** → Custom measures & calculations (e.g., utilization rate, waiting gap)

## 🚀 Recommendations for Improvement

- **Reduce Cancellations**:  
  - Implement automated reminders  
  - Introduce cancellation waitlists  
  - Analyze cancellation reasons  

- **Boost Appointment Volume**:  
  - Launch recall campaigns  
  - Promote same-day bookings  

- **Actively Manage Patient Flow**:  
  - Encourage online booking  
  - Offer incentives for off-peak slots  

- **Data-Driven Decisions**:  
  - Use KPIs to plan staffing  
  - Optimize scheduling  
  - Improve hospital efficiency

## 📈 Impact

This project demonstrates how data-driven hospital management can:
- Improve doctor time utilization  
- Reduce idle capacity due to cancellations  
- Enhance patient engagement  
- Support better hospital efficiency and revenue growth  

✨ By combining analytics with strategic recommendations, this dashboard helps healthcare organizations move from reactive reporting to proactive optimization.
